# Indoor Positioning Models

This repository contains implementations of three indoor positioning models: Hidden Markov Model (HMM), N-Lateration, and Fingerprinting. Each model is implemented in a separate directory along with code examples and relevant documentation.

## Models

### 1. Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

- Description: Implementation of a Hidden Markov Model for indoor positioning.
- Features:
  - Simulates a basic Markov chain with transition probabilities.
  - Allows users to navigate through a sequence of states.

### 2. N-Lateration

- Description: Implementation of the N-Lateration algorithm for indoor positioning.
- Features:
  - Estimates the position of a mobile object based on distances from multiple access points.
  - Provides comparisons between different estimation methods.


### 3. Fingerprinting

- Description: Implementation of the Fingerprinting method for indoor positioning.
- Features:
  - Uses signal strength measurements to determine the position of a mobile device.
  - Includes a comparison with other positioning methods.
